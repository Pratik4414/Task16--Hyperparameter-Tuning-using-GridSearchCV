# Task 16: Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV

## Objective
To perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained default Random Forest model
- Applied GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation
- Extracted best parameters
- Compared default and tuned model performance

## Best Parameters
(Add your output here manually after running notebook)

## Conclusion
Hyperparameter tuning improved model performance by selecting optimal parameters.
